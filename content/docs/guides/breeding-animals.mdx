description: Tutorial how to breed animals and what items are needed for that.

In actual version of Hytale, breeding animals is not yet implemented. However, we have added the ability to breed certain animals using specific items.

All in-game animals you can find on [https://hytaleguide.net/](https://hytaleguide.net/mobs)

## Requirements
To breed animals, you need to have two adult animals of the same species and the required items for breeding. For example two cows, two sheep, two pigs, etc.
